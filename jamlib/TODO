// = Complete Application
//  = client side (C)
  = NodeJS side
  = Test...

//  = Clean up existing code

= Function call
  = Client to Cloud
  = Cloud to Client
  = Client to Web
  = Web to Client
  = Cloud to Web
  = Web to Cloud

= Automate the web interface management
  = Link web to the application, web interface is just a UI for the application.
  = Use a templating library? How would this impact with SpaceOS?
  = Can we use XML or XHTML for templating? Examine the pros and cons

= Live Variables
  = Use UDP versus TCP for function calls?
  = Where would the reliability model be specified? Part of the application properties?

= Data Streaming

= Event Distribution
  = Application local events
  = Application to application events
  = To all devices (running the same application)
  = A particular device running a given application

= Debugging and Tracing Framework
  = Use this to demonstrate the framework
  = Visualize the interactions using the tracing framework

= Things in JavaScript
	= Provide JavaScript interfaces for real world objects
	= Objects are not going to run NodeJS
	= Objects are running Jam runtime.
	= Jam provides a way to run a program that has C + JavaScript + XML
		= JavaScript runs on a SpaceOS/POM server
		= Messages are sent from that server to the actual object that implements the actual routine
	
// This is super vague.. we need to refine this
= Architecture design...
  = Break the architecture into small components...
  = Implement it!

## Anatomy of a JAMScript Program

JAMScript is based on a **controller-worker** model. The controllers
can be at different levels: cloud, fog, and device levels. The workers can
*only* be in the device level. A controller at the device level can have one or
more workers underneath it. Similarly, a controller at the cloud or fog levels can have
more or sub controllers in the lower levels underneath it. Those sub controllers can have
workers provided the sub controller is in the device level.
A worker has exactly one parent controller that is located in the device level.
In addition, the worker would be optionally connected to a controller at the fog level and
cloud level depending on the system configuration. The controller-worker relationship is
*symmetric* in that a worker that is underneath a controller also sees that controller as its
parent.

 similar to the one that
underpins popular paradigms such as [Software Defined
Networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking). The
*controller* and *worker* are co-programmed. That is, a single program is
developed for the controller and worker combination. In JAMScript, the
controller portion of the program is written in JavaScript and the worker
portion of the program is written in C.

In the simplest scenario, we can have a single controller and a single worker.
To run a JAMScript program we need to instantiate both components: controller
worker. The controller can call the worker or the worker can initiate calls on
the controller. Quite easily, we can generalize this setup to include multiple
workers.


A little bit more complex




The program
running in the components can initiate a call from the controller to worker
or from the worker to the controller.

language that incorporates the

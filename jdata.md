# JAMDatasource  

JAMDatasource is the core of data transmission among different machines in a JAM system. Its value can be updated to trigger certain actions on its subscriber applications both locally and on other machines, through another data type called JAMDatastream.  

JAMDatasource has two subtypes: JAMLogger and JAMBroadcaster, with the former being a bottom-up data media, and the latter a top-down channel.    

## JAMLogger

A JAMLogger keeps track of the changes of a value. Instances of JAMLogger should be declared in J-node applications, which is then able to subscribe user-defined functions to the logger when its value gets updated. The value tracked can be changed by a C-node, if the J-node is at device level, or by a device-level J-node, if the J-node is at fog or cloud level.   

### **Declaring a logger variable**
A logger has to be declared in a jdata{...} section.
```shell
jdata{
	<type> <name> as logger;
}
```
`<type>`: the type of the value that the logger keeps track of. Possible values: int, double, float, char*, and user-defined structures.
`<name>`: the name of this logger.

**Example:** declaring a logger to keep track of an integer value:
```shell
jdata {
	int candidate1 as logger;
}
```

A structure logger is declared using the syntax of C Prgoramming Language.  
**Example:** declaring another logger to keep track of an user-defined type - struct weather:
```shell
jdata {
	struct weather{
		float temperature;
		float humidity;
		float wind;
		char* air_quality;
		char* UV;
	} MTLWeather as logger;
}
```  
  
### **Subscribing a logger to callbacks**  
The **subscribe()** method pushes a callback function to the logger that it is called upon, such that all the applications that listens to this logger will call that function when the logger records a new value change.  
```shell  
jdata {
	int aNumber as logger;
}

aNumber.subscribe(function(key, entry, datastream){
	console.log("New data:",entry);
});
```

**Syntax**  
JAMLogger.subscribe(function callback(key, entry, datastream){
	// ...
})  

**Return value**  
None  

**Parameters**  
callback  
	the function that is called by all listener applications of the logger that **subscribe()** is called upon.  

	key  
		the identifier of the logger that **subscribe()** is called upon.
	entry  
		the new data whose arrival triggers this callback function.
	datastream  
		the identifier of the listener application of the logger.  
  


## JAMBroadcaster  
A JAMBroadcaster is responsible for broadcasting data in a top-down fashion, i,e. from cloud to fog or device, or from fog to device. Unlike JAMLogger, a broadcaster actively sends data instead of waiting for other applications to update its value.  
  
### **Declaring a broadcaster variable**
A logger has to be declared in a jdata{...} section.
```shell
jdata{
	<type> <name> as broadcaster;
}
```
`<type>`: the type of the value that the logger keeps track of. Possible values: int, double, float, char*, and user-defined structures.
`<name>`: the name of this broadcaster.

**Example:** declaring a broadcaster to broadcast integer values:
```shell
jdata {
	int num as broadcaster;
}
```

A structure broadcaster is declared using the syntax of C Prgoramming Language.  
**Example:** declaring another broadcaster to broadcast time - struct myTime:
```shell
jdata {
	struct myTime{
        int year;
        int month;
        int date;
        int hour;
        int minute;
        int second;
        char* display;
	}MTLTime as broadcaster;
}
```  
  
# JAMDatastream  

To run a J-node, we have to supply an app name with `--app=APP_NAME`. This app name is later used to referred to this application in other programs, such that they can access datasources declared in it. Whenever a program subscribes to a logger in another program, or receives data from a broadcaster on a higher level machine, a datastream is created and bridges data between these two ends.  
Users of JAMScript do not initialize datastreams as they are internally created. We provide rich APIs for you to manipulate information about and data stored in datastreams.  

#### JAMDatastream.size()  
The **size()** method returns the number of records the logger has tracked.

	console.log("aNumber has recorded "+size+" value changes");
	// stdout: aNumber has recorded 10 value changes
});

# Flow  

Flow is an abstract data type that enables efficient processing of large data sets. It enables data transmission cross applications. 
  
## 5 Types of Flow  
Flow has 5 subtypes: IteratorFlow, OutFlow, InFlow, DiscretizedFlow and ParallelFlow. They are grouped based on the type of operations that can be performed on them. All of them inherit Flow methods and Flow functions defined in Flow class, and have their own specialized functionalities.  

### IteratorFlow  
IteratorFlow is usually the first Flow created on raw data structures. Other flows can be created by applying flow methods on an iterator flow, which is the root flow in the flow chain and can be accessed via the property `rootFlow`.  

#### **Declaring a IteratorFlow variable**  
An IteratorFlow can be built upon various data structures, including Array, Set, Map, Object, FileSystem, Generator, JAMDatasource and JAMDatastream.  
Unlike JAMDatasource which can only be declared inside a jdata{...} section, an IteratorFlow can be created both in or outside of it.

##### ** `Flow.from()` creates a IteratorFlow outside of jdata{...} section**    

```shell
jdata{
	<loggerType> <loggerName> as logger;
}

// Creates a IteratorFlow on a JAMLogger
var aFlow = Flow.from(<loggerName>);

var a = [1,2,3,4,5];

// Creates a IteratorFlow on an array  
var f = Flow.from(a);

// creates a flow contains only the even number in firstFlow
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.where(entry => entry.data%2==0);
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.from(data);    
**Parameter**  
A variable of type Array, Set, Map, Object, FileSystem, Generator, JAMDatasource or JAMDatastream
**Return value**  
An IteratorFlow contains all data in the argument data structure.  
  
##### **Creates an IteratorFlow in jdata{...} section**
An IteratorFlow built upon a JAMDatasource can be declared either in a jdata{...} section or outside as above.  

```shell
jdata{
	<dataType> <aDatasource> as <datasourceType>;
	<flowName> as flow with <flowFunc> of <aDatasource>
}

function <flowFunc> (rawFlow){
	// ...
}
```  
Declare a JAMDatasource first. Then declare the IteratorFlow built upon it.  
`<flowName>`: the name of this IteratorFlow variable.  
`<flowFunc>`: the name of the function to process the raw IteratorFlow from the intended logger.  
`<aDatasource>`: the name of the JAMDatasource variable on which this Iterator flow is initialized.
  
`function <flowFunc> (rawFlow)`:   
Every IteratorFlow on a JAMDatasource has to be associated with a function to process the raw flow.  
**Parameter**  
rawFlow: the raw IteratorFlow contains all data that the datasource on which the IteratorFlow is built recorded.  
**Return value**  
A flow.  
  
**Example:**
```shell
jdata{
	struct weather{
		int date;
		int highTemperature;
		int lowTemperature;
		float humidity;
		float wind;
		char* airQuality;
		char* UV;
	} MTLWeather as logger;

	stats as flow with statsFunc of MTLWeather; 
}  

function statsFunc(rawFlow){
	return rawFlow.select(function(entry){
		return entry.data;
	});
}
```
The above code first declares a logger called `MTLWeather` with type `struct weather`, then an IteratorFlow with name `stats` and a function `statsFunc` on logger `MTLWeather`. `statsFunc` takes `stats` flow as its argument, and returns a flow created by a flow method `select`.
  
### OutFlow & InFlow 
An OutFlow is responsible for processing and sending data across applications, while an InFlow is receiving data from other applications. In most cases, we let these two types of flow work together to perform communication between two JAM applications.  

#### **Declare an OutFlow variable**  
```shell
jdata{
	<dataType> <aDatasource> as <datasourceType>;
	<flowName> as flow with <flowFunc> of <aDatasource>;
	<outflowName> as outflow of <flowName>;
}
  
function <flowFunc> (rawFlow){
	// ...
}

<outflowName>.start();
```  
  
Declare an Iterator flow first, then create an outflow on it.  
`outflowName`: the name of the outflow variable.  
`flowName`: the name of the Iterator flow on which the outflow is created.  
`<outflowName>.start()`: start piping data from flow to the outflow. Now the outflow contains all the data in the flow.  

**Example**
```shell
jdata{
	int sensorStatus as logger;
	f as flow with flowFunc of sensorStatus;
	outF as outflow of f; 
}

outF.start();

function flowFunc(inputFlow){
	return inputFlow;
}
```
  
#### **Declare an InFlow variable**  
```shell
jdata{
	<inflowName> as inflow of app://<outflowAPP>.<outflowName>;
}
```  
  
Declare an inflow by specifying the path of the outflow it listens to.    
`inflowName`: the name of the inflow variable.  
`outflowAPP`: the name of the application where the outflow listened to resides.  
`outflowName`: the name of the outflow that the inflow listens to.  

**Example**
```shell
jdata{
	sensorStatus as inflow of app://t.outF;
}
```  
Here the outflow path is `app://t.outF`. `t` is the APP_NAME that we supplied to the J-node when running the outflow application. `outF` is the name of the outflow that feeds data to the inflow created.   
  
#### DiscretizedFlow  
This Flow splits data streams into chunks/windows to allow for Flow methods that require finite data operations.  
  

### Flow Operations  
Flow operations can either be methods/transformations (operations that yield other Flows) or actions (operations that yield a result).
  
* Flow methods  
Each flow method is a data transformation that yields another flow. A flow maintains a call tree to the flow operation before it. A flow method is lazily computed as the data is continuously pipelined to the next level of flow and is only computed when a flow action is called upon it.    

#### The `Flow.limit(Number)` method limits the number of results obtained after the previous operation.
```shell
var firstFlow = Flow.from([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]);
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.limit(4);	// anotherFlow contains [1,2,3,4]
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.limit(n)  
**Parameter**
n: an integer indicating the number of data to pipe.  
**Return value**  
A flow that contains the first n data from the root flow. 

#### The `Flow.skip()` method ignores the first given number of results found after a previous operation.
```shell
var firstFlow = Flow.from([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]);
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.skip(4);	// anotherFlow contains [5,6,7]
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.skip(n)  
**Parameter**
n: an integer indicating the number of data to skip.  
**Return value**  
A flow that contains all data excluding the first n data from the root flow.   

#### The `Flow.select()` method is similar to map in mad-reduce operations. It applies a provided function on every entry in the calling flow.  
```shell
var firstFlow = Flow.from([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]);
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.select(entry => entry*2);	// anotherFlow contains [2,4,6,8,10,12,14]
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.select(aFunction)  
**Parameter**
aFunction: a function that is going to be applied on every entry in the calling flow.
**Return value**  
A flow that contains all data returned by applying the provided function on every entry in the calling flow.  
  
#### The `Flow.selectFlatten()` flattens a flow of arrays.
```shell
var firstFlow = Flow.from([1,2,3],[4,5],[6,7,8,9]);
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.selectFlatten();	// anotherFlow contains [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.selectFlatten()  
**Parameter**
None
**Return value**  
A flow that contains all data in the calling flow in the flattened form.  
  
#### The `Flow.selectExpand()` flattens a flow of arrays and applies the provided function to each entry of the flattened flow. The collection generated by function must be supported by Flow.from(...).  
```shell
var firstFlow = Flow.from([1,2,3],[4,5],[6,7,8,9]);
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.selectExpand(data => data*2);	// anotherFlow contains [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18]
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.selectExpand(aFunction)  
**Parameter**
aFunction: a function that is going to be applied on each data in the flattened flow.
**Return value**  
A flow that contains all results returned by applying the provided function on every data in the calling flow in the flattened form.  

#### The `Flow.where()` method performs a filtering operation on the data to match a constraint.  
```shell
var firstFlow = Flow.from([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]);
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.where(entry => entry%2 == 0);	// anotherFlow contains [1, 4, 6]
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.where(aFunction)    
**Parameter**  
aFunction: a function that is going to be applied on each data in the flattened flow. It returns a boolean.  
**Return value**  
A flow that contains all data whose `aFunction(data)` is true.  


#### `Flow.orderBy()` method performs a sorting operation on the data based on a given function. 
```shell
var firstFlow = Flow.from([9,1,8,3,7,4,2,5,6]);

// anotherFlow contains [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]  
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.orderBy();	

// anotherFlow contains [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]  
var yetAnotherFlow = firstFlow.orederBy((data1, data2) => {
	if(data1 < data2) return -1;
	if(data1 > data2) return 1;
	return 0;
});		
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.orderBy(compareFunction)  
**Parameter**
compareFunction (optional): a function that defines an alternative sort order. The function takes two arguments, say data1 and data2. If a positive value is returned, then data1 is sorted before data2; if a negative value is returned, then data2 is sorted before data1; if 0 is returned, then data1 and data2 preserves their original order.  
**Return value**  
A flow that contains all data in the calling flow in the intended sorted order.  
  
#### The `Flow.groupBy()` method returns a new Flow containing several datasets grouped by a specified key. 
```shell
var firstFlow = Flow.from([
	{	
		type: "student",
		year: "U2"
		name: "Lilly"
	},
	{
		type: "student",
		year: "U0"
		name: "Jim"
	},
	{
		type: "professor",
		name: "Tom"
	},
	{
		type: "professor",
		name: "Anne"
	}
]);


/* anotherFlow contains 
{
	"student": [
		{	
			type: "student",
			year: "U2"
			name: "Lilly"
		},
		{
			type: "student",
			year: "U0"
			name: "Jim"
		}
	],
	"professor":[
		{
			type: "professor",
			name: "Tom"
		},
		{
			type: "professor",
			name: "Anne"
		}
	]
}
*/
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.groupBy("type");	
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.groupBy(key)    
**Parameter**  
key: a string indicating the key used to group data in the calling flow.
**Return value**  
A flow containing data in the calling flow partitioned into groups of array determined by the values of the intended key.  

#### The `iteratorFlow.merge()` method is only available to an object of IteratorFlow and is used to merge a supported data structure. Merging creates an Iterator and adds it to the current Iterator or Iterators.   
  
#### The `Flow.range()` method creates a bound for the data to be used for further processing.
```shell
var firstFlow = Flow.from([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]);

// anotherFlow contains [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]  
var anotherFlow = firstFlow.range(2, 8);	// another flow contains: [3,4,5,6,7,8]
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.range(startIndex, endIndex)  
**Parameter**  
startIndex: an integer indicating the index of the first element (inclusive)  
endIndex: an integer indicating the index of the last element (exclusive)  
**Return value**  
A flow that contains data with indices between startIndex (inclusive) and endIndex (exclusive) in the calling flow.   

#### The `Flow.discretize()` method is only available to the IteratorFlow and allows processing data streams in windows.  
```shell
jdata{
	int x as logger;
	f as flow with flowFunc of x;
}

function flowFunc(f){
	return f.discretize(3, 5);   
}
```  
**Syntax**  
Flow.discretize.(span, spanLength[, spawnFlows])   
**Parameter**  
span: span is the number of data streams to focus on in a window.  
spanLength: either a Number or a function that tells when we get to the end of a window. 
spawnFlows: an optional boolean value that states if the output should be objects of DiscretizedFlow or simple arrays. spawnFlows defaults to true.   
**Return value**  
A flow that contains arrays of data from the specified number of datastreams. Each array contains the first `spanLength` data from a datastream that subscribes to the data structure on which the flow is built.

JAM C Parser/Translator
=======================

OPEN:	main(x, y) {} does not work. The *space* is creating parsing problem.
		main(x,y) {} works!

OPEN:	function declaration is not properly checked. May be we are
		just doing the syntactic checking. A declaration like
		xx {} is passing through the parser. It should be xx() {}.
		Semantic checking could fix this?
				= Modified the parser.. I think this is the correct approach
				= Slightly different from the grammar spec..

FIXED: 	Additional semicolon on all lines before the last one.
		The last line seems to be immune of the problem.

===================================
MISSING FEATURES (From C front end)

2.	Suffix for integers and floats
3.	Prefix for strings
4. 	Abstract declarator .. low priority .. how to test?

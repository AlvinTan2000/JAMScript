<p>Cloud of Moving Things (CoMT) is a computing model that combines the widely popular cloud computing with Internet of Things (IoT). One of the major problems with CoMT is the latency of accessing distant cloud resources from the devices, where the data is captured. To address this problem, paradigms such as fog computing and Cloudlets have been proposed to interpose another layer of computing between the clouds and devices. Such a three-layered cloud-fog-device computing architecture is touted as the most suitable approach for deploying many next generation ubiquitous computing applications. Programming applications to run on such a platform is quite challenging because disconnections between the different layers are bound to happen in a large-scale CoMT system, where the devices can be mobile.</p>

<p>JAMScript is a polyglot programming language that combines C and JavaScript for a three-layered CoT system. A proof-of-concept compiler and runtime for different distributed systems are provided in this repository. Our goal is to get JAMScript to work in many platforms so that heterogeneous systems can be developed using it. You can see the associated publications to learn about the whole concept.</p>

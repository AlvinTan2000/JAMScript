subtitle: A Language and Middleware for Cloud of Moving Things

Cloud computing is the backend of choice for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications
that create high rate data streams. Despite its widespread acceptance, cloud computing has
its share of drawbacks: high and variable access latency, global computing context, and
data privacy concerns.



To provide reduce the access latency, improve reliability
and localize the context, fog computing has been introduced to the mix as well.

<p> Cloud of Moving Things (CoMT) is a computing model that combines the widely popular
cloud computing with Internet of Things (IoT).
One of the major problems with CoMT is the latency of accessing distant cloud resources from the
devices, where the data is captured. To address this problem, paradigms such
as fog computing and Cloudlets have been proposed to interpose another layer
of computing between the clouds and devices. Such a three-layered
cloud-fog-device computing architecture is touted as the most suitable
approach for deploying many next generation ubiquitous computing
applications. Programming applications to run on such a platform is quite
challenging because disconnections between the different layers are bound to
happen in a large-scale CoMT system, where the devices can be mobile. </p>

This needs to be modified.


<p>JAMScript is a polglot programming language that combines C and JavaScript
for a three-layered CoT system. A proof-of-concept compiler and runtime for
different distributed systems are provided in this repository.
Our goal is to get JAMScript to work in many platforms so that heterogeneous
systems can be developed using it. You can see the associated publications to
learn about the whole concept.</p>

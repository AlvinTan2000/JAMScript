So to make this work, you should first install libarchive.
There are more precise instructions in the libarchive folder for that
Then make in this folder
The resulting runnable jamrun can be executed

The most basic way to execute it is in this manner
jamrun -[js|s|c] -filepath 
e.g jamrun -s dummy.jxe

WARNING
For some reason when I attemped to run server.js, it resulted in Unique Index Violation, duplicated app id found which I am presuming is a database error(nedb), not javascript error. 

In addition the c file needs to have two functions 
user_main
user_setup
This is what the dynamic loader is attempting to find
if not found, the loading for that particular c file will fail

 * A structure to hold the outgoing and incoming command. An incoming command (in JSON format) is parsed
 * and the values are populated in 'name' and 'params'. The param_type holds the type of the parameter.
 * We do only a level one parse. We assume the following format for the incoming message.
 * {name: NAME, args: ARRAY of ARGS, sign: SIGNATURE}
 * The ARRAY of ARGS could hold other objects as well. In that case, they are not parsed any further.
 * It is better to use the parsedCmd to descipher the message further.

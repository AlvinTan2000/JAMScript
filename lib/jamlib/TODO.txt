        Immediate Implementation Plan
        =============================

        = Sync message from J to C: get the message transmitted
        = JAMWorker processing the message without synchronization

        = Test the program with blocking J to C call but no synchronization

        ======= Should be working without synchronization ===========


= Insert synchronization tasks into the table
= Dequeue synchronized tasks at the next synchronous time slot






= Synchronization between two C nodes

= Extend to more than two C nodes

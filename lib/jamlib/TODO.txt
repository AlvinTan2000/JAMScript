Embed the conditional into the command structure
    = Encoding
    = Decoding

Revise the JavaScript side 
Test the embedding and get old programs working

We need an API or structure for JCond execution. This needs to be 
formulated so that JData works with it.

Inform Ross about the API. His API needs to be compatible (similar) with
this one.

C to J Asynchronous

    = Pass the execution from bottom up
    = No need to send all the levels a simultaneous execution request. 
      This should simplify the execution flow for the program.

C to J Synchronous

    = Contact the root of the sub machine. If the root is unable to execute we fail.
    = Once the root executes, we ask the rest of the machine to execute.

Test disconnection tolerance
Test performance and scaling


Conditional execution of the two C to J variations
    = We need to cover the conditional execution of the two variations.

J to C Asynchronous


J to C Synchronous

Conditional execution of the two J to C variations


Test scaling

= Get different port numbers from Registration
    = Port numbers should be based on the devidrcd..

= Open new or not working services

= Connect to the service and check whether it is working.. we need
  use a PING/PONG service.

= Try multiple devices

= PING/PONG is the heartbeat of the system

= Disconnect and reconnect of the devices

= Get REXEC working:

= Call from Device to J-core
= Call from J-core to single device, multiple devices, etc

= Check fault tolerance...

= We need to store state at the server side too! This is another headache!

= Load the necessary modules
= Setup the publish-subscribe socket
= Setup the survey socket
    = Handler for the survey socket, which is little tricky. You open the
      survey socket in the j-core. The repondentant socket is opened at the
      j-core by the c-core. So when the survey is sent out from the j-core,
      the c-core would get triggered and they should respond to the survey.


= Setup the reply socket
    = Handler on reply should handle the following
        = PING: reply with PONG; should there by any
          performance measures on the PING-PONG like latency?
        = REXEC: remote execution of an activity
        = REGISTER: soft register a c-core; optionally the registering
          c-core can specify some attributes which can be used in the
          search process.
          There could be a REGISTER from Fog to cloud too.
        = DE-REGISTER: c-core is telling about its impending departure.
          tell the j-core that the c-core is leaving
          There could be a DE-REGISTER from Fog to cloud too.
        = DISCOVER: this is run only in the cloud version of the j-core.

        = REGISTER will enable heartbeating, which PING/PONG packets. A PING
          expects a PONG for it from the corresponding party.

        = What else?

= Implement the Remote Execute protocol on both directions

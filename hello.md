## Writing a Hello World program

For our program we are going to write a simple program that prints "Hello World" on a C client, but the message will be generated by a JavaScript node

### C

We will make use of a JavaScript activity called helloWorld, so we define the prototype for the activity:

```C
char * helloWorld();

int main() {
	printf("%s\n", helloWorld());
}
```


### JavaScript

Here we define the body of the helloWorld function:

```JS
jsync function helloWorld() {
	return "Hello World!";
}
```

The JAMScript source is in a single repository.
The tools and samples are inside the main repository under the `tools/` and `tests/` folders, respectively. 
To get the full source, run the following command from the folder where you want JAMScript downloaded.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/citelab/JAMScript
```  
This should create a *JAMScript* folder there.

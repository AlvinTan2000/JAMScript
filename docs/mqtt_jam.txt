Design Notes for MQTT JAM
=========================

We want to use MQTT to simplify many of the JAM actions. 

At each J node, we put a MQTT server (broker). The broker is responsible for the following
functions. 

Heartbeating. We use the built-in heartbeating functionality of the MQTT server. The servers
can detect disconnection. The clients can get a callback and react to the disconnection or
LWT messages from the broker. 

The connection is always to the up-level. That is, fog connects to the cloud and devices
connect to the fog. Not the other way around. 

The cloud or fog can detect about the departure of a low-level node by subscribing to
the LWT messages. 

At each MQTT broker, we have the "machine" messages and "level" messages. 

A Fog node subscribes to the machine messages at the cloud level. Any messages it gets
are injected into its broker as a machine level message. The devices do the same. 

So the machine level messages propagate down the hierarchy in a machine. At each stage
the message is interpreted. If the message is valid or relevant (depending on the logic
condition), it is propagated downwards.

The level messages work at the given level. No downward or upward propagation. 
This facility can be used in different ways, but it is used by the devices or C part of 
in the following way.

Device-C invokes the level functions by publishing the run request. It can happen
in two different ways:
    = Concurrent: All levels are told about the execution at the same time. The
    levels independently process the request and let the device know about the
    outcome. 

    = Sequential: The device is going through the level calls in a sequential manner.
    The device is responsible for figuring out which level it would call first. 
    
    From the level function implementation point-of-view, there is no difference between
    the two different schemes. 


Summary
=======
= Machines messages
= Level messages
= Disconnections to detect up failures
= LWT to detect down failures

= What else? We need events support as well. Events are propagated in the machine. 
Here is the topic hierarchy.

/machine/functions
/machine/events/internal
/machine/events/external

/level/functions


Plan
====

1. Put the MQTT server at each J node
2. Let the C node connect to the MQTT server
3. Get connections and disconnections working. 
4. Use the connections and disconnections to figure out network partitioning.
5. Network partitioning and node failures should be figured out.
6. Use LWT as well.
 
7. Implement the level function invocations
8. Revise the C-J and get it working. Use the concurrent mode
9. Test the C-J in different modes. 

10. Implement the machine messages
11. Use the machine messages to implement the J-C side
12. Test the J-C in different modes.

14. How does C-J and J-C work in failure and disconnection scenarios? 
    Test and fine tune the protocol configurations.

15. Get the eventing working.

16. Get the data pumping working through the MQTT server

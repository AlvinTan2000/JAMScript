== GlobalOutQueue
        == We need to figure out what should be done when a LOCAL packet is received at
           the globalOutQueue. The LOCAL packet is meant to do what kind of processing in
           this context??

== ActivityOutQueue
        == Same thing as the GlobalOutQueue. What do we need to do with the LOCAL packet??


== Get the callback handlers for the different kinds of packet sources.


=== Edit activity.c 
        = The way the elements are deleted needs to be fixed.

JAMScript Application Ideas
===========================

= Distributed computing approach for self-driving

= Vehicular network programming

= Self-organizing small cell programming 

= Self-organizing edge cloud orchestration


Software Defined Networks Using JAMScript (3D Networking?)
----------------------------------------------------------
* A merger of application-level load balancing and network-level packet processing?
* How does it work?

Socket is opened using a primitive function offered by a JAMScript program. 
What does this give? 



Socket open request is propagated to the cloud or fog. it could trigger a 
massive reverse call.

Long calls in JAMScript

1. Device to cloud and to device
s
The objective here is for one device to engage with another device.
We know the vicinity of the first device and also other parameters
such as vicinity, spatial attributes, and trust that determines which device
should be talking to which other device.

The devices could be pushing or pulling data from one another.

1.a. Pushing data to the infrastructure
When we push data from the devices to the infrastructure it goes to the
fogs through which the devices are connected to the infrastructure.
Sometimes we want place the data at different edge nodes so that reuse of the
data or the latency of reusing the data in further computations can be minimized.

How do we achieve this objective?

The device that wants the data pushes its location through a logger. The logger
data streams to the fog and cloud levels. The routines at the fog and cloud levels
could learn the characteristics about the device or group of devices using the
logged values.

The cloud and/or fog uses the values from the logged values to determines
parameters it should use in the call to the devices.

The interesting part is that the call from the device can reach all the way to
the cloud and come back or it could be turned back at the fog. When we turn back
at the fog, we could use the fog-level context instead of the cloud-level context used
with the cloud turn back.

Cloud and Fog Design
====================

Cloud service is built around a ZooKeeper (ZK) server.
The ZK server is responsible for maintaining the state and performing the coordination
activities. The JAMScript components are built around the clients provided by the ZooKeeper.

The Fog server will connect to the ZK server under the /cloud/fog tree. We can find the fogs
that are connected by examining the children of the /cloud/fog branch. 
 

JAMScript Cloud Component

A cloud client for the ZK server is expected to do the following tasks.

= Connect to the ZK server
= Registers itself under /cloud/clients
= Each client could have a unique number which could be a sequence number

= It watches for Fog changes and notifies the JAMScript program accordingly by generating
  appropriate events in the JAMScript domain.
  
= What else should this do?


JAMScript Fog Component

A Fog client for the ZK server is expected to do the following tasks.

= Connect to the ZK server
= Registers iself under /cloud/fog/
= Each fog has a unique number which is its sequence number
= Under its own tree we will find client information (IP address or port)

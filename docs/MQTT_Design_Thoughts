Tree time
    What is this useful for?

    We can detect inconsistent scenarios that needs user application intervention.

    How the tree time advances?

    What happens when a new device joins?

    Tree time inheritence?
    What actions should be executed on the newly arriving device?

We also assume that the clock is synchronized across the system. So, why do weed a tree time??

## JView

## Controllers
Controllers are widgets that are capable of sending commands to the backend and control. They are part of the output side of JView. These widgets have different configurations possible to bring a variety of control over a JAMScript program from an arbitrary web browser.

There are currently 3 types of widgets: a slider, a button and a terminal. The slider and button have several modes to personalize the way the data is sent to the backend. The terminal is an abstraction of an actual machine's terminal.
